MERN Website for Database Table Analysis with Gemini API
Project Description
This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) website designed to process natural language queries and identify relevant database tables from a provided schema. It leverages the Google Gemini API to understand user queries and map them to database schema elements.

Functionality:

Natural Language Query Input: Users can enter natural language queries through a web interface.
Database Schema Parsing: The backend parses a database schema from a JSON file, extracting table names and column names.
Gemini API Integration: The application sends the user's natural language query and the database schema information to the Google Gemini API.
Relevant Table Identification: The Gemini API analyzes the query and schema and returns a list of database tables that are most relevant to the user's intent.
Frontend Display: The frontend displays the list of relevant tables identified by the Gemini API to the user.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Vite - Fast build tool and development server for modern web projects
Axios - Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend
Backend:
Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
Express.js - Minimalist web application framework for Node.js
google-generativeai - Google Gemini API client library for Node.js
dotenv - Loads environment variables from a .env file
cors - Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Database (Conceptual):
MongoDB - NoSQL database (while MongoDB is part of MERN, this project currently focuses on schema analysis and doesn't directly interact with a MongoDB database for data storage in this version).
Natural Language Processing (for comparison - TF-IDF & NER method):
spaCy - Library for advanced Natural Language Processing
scikit-learn - Machine learning library in Python (for TF-IDF)
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 20 or higher recommended) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
MongoDB installed and running locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster (though MongoDB is not directly used in this version, having it installed is part of the MERN stack setup).
A Google Gemini API key. You'll need to obtain an API key from the Google AI Studio.
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory:

Bash

touch .env
Open .env and add your Gemini API key and optionally configure the port:

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
PORT=5000  # Optional: Change port if needed
Important: Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key. Do not commit the .env file to version control for security reasons.

Run the backend server:

Bash

node server.js
The server should start and you should see the message Server listening on port 5000 (or the port you configured).

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd frontend
Initialize the Vite React app and install dependencies:

Bash

npm create vite@latest client --template react
cd client
npm install
npm install axios
Start the frontend development server:

Bash

npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and go to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

How to Run the Application
Start the backend server in one terminal window (from the backend directory): node server.js
Start the frontend development server in another terminal window (from the frontend/client directory): npm run dev
Access the application in your browser at the URL provided by Vite (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
Enter your natural language query in the input field on the website.
Click "Analyze Query".
The website will display the list of relevant database tables identified by the Gemini API based on your query and the provided schema.
Usage Example
Query: Show me customer orders for products named apples

Expected Output: The application should display relevant tables such as:

Orders
Order_Items
Products
Customers
These tables are identified as relevant because they contain information about orders, items within orders, product names, and customer details, which are all related to the user's query.

Environment Variables
backend/.env:
GEMINI_API_KEY: Required. Your Google Gemini API key. Keep this secret and do not commit to version control.
PORT: Optional. Port for the backend server to listen on (default is 5000).
Further Development
This is a basic implementation and can be extended in several ways:

Enhanced Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling in both frontend and backend to gracefully manage API errors, network issues, and invalid user inputs.
Improved Frontend Styling: Enhance the user interface with CSS styling to improve visual appeal and user experience.
Database Query Execution: Extend the backend to not only identify relevant tables but also to execute actual database queries based on the NL query and schema, and return data to the frontend.
Schema Management: Allow users to upload or select different database schemas dynamically through the frontend.
Security Enhancements: Implement security best practices for API key management, input validation, and secure communication (HTTPS) for a production-ready application.
Deployment: Deploy the MERN application to a cloud hosting platform like Heroku, Netlify, AWS, or Google Cloud to make it accessible online.
